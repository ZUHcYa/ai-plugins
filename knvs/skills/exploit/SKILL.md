# /knvs:exploit

## Purpose

Moves a validated canvas from `explore/` to `exploit/` for scaling.

## When to Use

- When critical hypotheses have been validated through experiments
- Transitioning a canvas from `explore/` to `exploit/` for scaling

## Workflow

```
User: /knvs:exploit
Claude: Which idea is ready for scaling?

        1. AI Bookkeeping (4/4 hypotheses validated)
        2. Fitness App (2/4 hypotheses validated - not ready)

User: 1
Claude: Analyzing validation results...

        Validated Hypotheses:
        - Pricing: EUR 19/month (validated via survey)
        - AI Accuracy: 90% (validated via prototype)
        - Market Size: 500k freelancers (validated via data analysis)
        - Churn: <5% (validated via pilot users)

        Canvas moved: explore/ai-bookkeeping.md -> exploit/ai-bookkeeping.md
        Status: EXPLOIT

        Next Review: [date + 3 months]

        Next Steps:
        - Schedule first review with /knvs:review
        - Monitor disruption risks
```

## What the Skill Does

1. Lists all canvases in `explore/` folder
2. Scans `hypotheses/<canvas-slug>/` for hypothesis validation status
3. Warns if not all hypotheses are validated
4. User confirms transition
5. **Moves file from `explore/` to `exploit/`**
6. Updates canvas `status` to `scaling`
7. Sets `next_review` date (default: +3 months)
8. Adds Reviews section

## Validation Check

Before transition, the skill checks:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Hypotheses | Critical hypotheses should have status VALIDATED |
| Experiments | At least one experiment completed per hypothesis |
| Insights | Experiment results documented |

If requirements are not met, the skill warns but allows override:

```
Claude: Warning: 1 hypothesis is still pending validation.

        - Customer Segment: Not yet tested

        Do you want to proceed anyway? (y/n)
```

## Notes

- File is physically moved from `explore/` to `exploit/`
- Status in frontmatter changes to `scaling`
- `next_review` date is set to 3 months from now
- `disruption_risk` defaults to MEDIUM

## Next Steps

After transitioning to EXPLOIT:
- Schedule regular reviews with `/knvs:review` (recommended: quarterly)
- Monitor market and technology disruption risks
- Use `/knvs:start` to track all business models
